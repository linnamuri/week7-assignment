Below are my results and observations after running this program for various sizes of arrays (tiny,small,medium, large and extra large).

As the size of array increases, the runtime for unshift is taking longer. Push seems to be performing better than unshift for larger arrays.

Runtime seems to be constant O(1) for push, whereas runtime for unshift is O(n)
